I am a Research Assistant Professor in the **Artificial Intelligence** at **[Nagoya Institute of Technology](https://www.nitech.ac.jp/)**.  
I conduct my research in the **[Hirata & Kodera Lab](https://cem.web.nitech.ac.jp/hilab/)** advised by **[Prof. Hirata](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zSV81YwAAAAJ)**.  
I received a Ph.D. degree in engineering from the **[University of Toyama](https://www.u-toyama.ac.jp/)**, Toyama, Japan, in 2022.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Machine / Deep Learning**, **Computational Neuroscience**, **Neural Networks**, **Evolutionary Computation**, and **Bioinformatics**.

Outside of research, I enjoy **traveling** and **photography**.

**I am looking for M.E. / B.E. students majoring in engineering, but not limited to, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. In addition, I am pleased to collaborate with researchers who are interested in advising on medical-related projects. If you are interested in my field of research, please feel free to email me.**
