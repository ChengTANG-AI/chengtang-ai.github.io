I am a tenured **Assistant Professor** in the **Faculty of Information Science and Electrical Engineering** at **[Kyushu University](https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/ja/)**. I conduct my research in the **[Laboratory for Image and Media Understanding](https://www.eng.kyushu-u.ac.jp/lab_electrical33.html)**, supervised by **[Prof. Shimada](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gc2kslQAAAAJ)**.  

I received my M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in engineering from the **[University of Toyama](https://www.u-toyama.ac.jp/)**, Toyama, Japan, in 2020 and 2022, respectively. From 2022 to 2023, I was an Assistant Professor at the **[Hirata Laboratory](https://cem.web.nitech.ac.jp/hilab/)**, supervised by **[Prof. Hirata](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zSV81YwAAAAJ)** (IEEE Fellow, ICNIRP Chair), Graduate School of Engineering Tsukuri College, **[Nagoya Institute of Technology](https://www.nitech.ac.jp/)**, Nagoya, Japan. In 2023, I joined **[Kyushu University](https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/ja/)**, Fukuoka, Japan, where I am currently an Assistant Professor (Tenured) with the Department of Advanced Information Technology, Graduate School and Faculty of Information Science and Electrical Engineering.

My main research interests are **[Medical Data Mining](https://chengtang-ai.github.io/ResearchTopics/)**, **[Time Series Forecasting](https://chengtang-ai.github.io/ResearchTopics/)**, **[Computer Vision](https://chengtang-ai.github.io/ResearchTopics/)**, **[Natural Language Processing](https://chengtang-ai.github.io/ResearchTopics/)**, **[Learning Analytics](https://chengtang-ai.github.io/ResearchTopics/)**, **[AI for Drug Design](https://chengtang-ai.github.io/ResearchTopics/)**, **[Explainable AI (XAI)](https://chengtang-ai.github.io/ResearchTopics/)**,  and **[Optimization](https://chengtang-ai.github.io/ResearchTopics/)**. 

I have published over 70 articles in international journals/conferences, including  
・**[Neurocomputing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/neurocomputing)**,  
・**[Information Sciences](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/information-sciences)** (INS),
