I am a tenured **Assistant Professor** in the **Faculty of Information Science and Electrical Engineering** at **[Kyushu University](https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/ja/)**.  
I conduct my research in the **[Laboratory for Image and Media Understanding](https://www.eng.kyushu-u.ac.jp/lab_electrical33.html)** advised by **[Prof. Shimada](https://sites.google.com/view/atsushishimada/)**.  

I received my M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in engineering from the **[University of Toyama](https://www.u-toyama.ac.jp/)**, Toyama, Japan, in 2020 and 2022, respectively. From 2022 to 2023, I was an Assistant Professor at the **[Hirata　Laboratory](https://cem.web.nitech.ac.jp/hilab/)**, Graduate School of Engineering Tsukuri College, **[Nagoya Institute of Technology](https://www.nitech.ac.jp/)**, Nagoya, Japan. In 2023, I joined **[Kyushu University](https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/ja/)**, Fukuoka, Japan, where I am currently an Assistant Professor (Tenured) with the Department of Advanced Information Technology, Graduate School and Faculty of Information Science and Electrical Engineering.

My main research interests are **Machine / Deep Learning**, **Computational Neuroscience**, **Neural Networks**, **Evolutionary Computation**, **Bioinformatics**, **Learning Analytics**, and **Artificial Intelligence** in **Medical Big Data**. 

I have published over 50 articles in international journals / conferences, including
