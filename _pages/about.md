I am a tenured **Assistant Professor** in the **Artificial Intelligence** at **[Kyushu University](https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/ja/)**.  
I conduct my research in the **[Laboratory for Image and Media Understanding](https://www.eng.kyushu-u.ac.jp/lab_electrical33.html)** advised by **[Prof. Shimada](https://sites.google.com/view/atsushishimada/)**.  

I received my M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in engineering from the **[University of Toyama](https://www.u-toyama.ac.jp/)**, Toyama, Japan, in 2020 and 2022, respectively. From 2022 to 2023, I was an Assistant Professor at the **[Hirataã€€Laboratory](https://cem.web.nitech.ac.jp/hilab/)**, Graduate School of Engineering Tsukuri College, **[Nagoya Institute of Technology](https://www.nitech.ac.jp/)**, Nagoya, Japan. In 2023, I joined **[Kyushu University](https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/ja/)**, Fukuoka, Japan, where I am currently an Assistant Professor (Tenured) with the Department of Advanced Information Technology, Graduate School and Faculty of Information Science and Electrical Engineering.

My main research interests are **Machine / Deep Learning**, **Computational Neuroscience**, **Neural Networks**, **Evolutionary Computation**, and **Bioinformatics**, **Learning Analytics**, and **Artificial Intelligence** in **Medical Big Data**. 

I have published over 30 articles in international journals, such as  
**IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence (TETCI)**,  
**Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS)**,  
**Information Sciences (INS)**,  
**Expert Systems with Applications (ESWA)**,  
**Applied Soft Computing (ASOC)**,  
**Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence (EAAI)**,  
**Neurocomputing**,  
**IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP)**  
and so on. 

I serve as a peer reviewer for several international journals, such as  
**IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)**,  
**IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems (TFS)**,  
**IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles (TIV)**,  
**Information Fusion**,  
**Applied Soft Computing (ASOC)**,  
and so on.

Outside of research, I enjoy **traveling** and **photography**.

**I am looking for M.E. / B.E. students majoring in engineering, but not limited to, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. In addition, I am pleased to collaborate with researchers who are interested in advising on medical-related projects. If you are interested in my field of research, please feel free to email me.**
